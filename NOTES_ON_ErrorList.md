This problem arose with Django 4.0 when they added functionality.
See: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/releases/4.0/#template-based-form-rendering

Only some tests in dcolumn/dcolumns/tests/test_dcolumns_forms.py fail.

As of now 2024-05-05 I do not know what the fix needs to be. There is very
little usage of this Django plugin so it is at the bottom of my list to fix.
